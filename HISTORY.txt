2014-04-10 Version 2.1.0

	Added :nsq (non-sequential = sparse + random) selector for
	#length/#size, #keys, #values, #to_a, and #to_h.

	Fixed some deprecated methods to have pre-2.0.0 behavior after
	2.0.0 changes (i.e. :nsq versus :rnd differences).

	Added #reindex method to reindex sparse values (like #compact!
	but without nil removal).

2014-04-01 Version 2.0.1

	Fixed incorrect indexes in "Background" section of comments.

2014-03-31 Version 2.0.0

	Major rewrite. Note: #slice and #slice! are incompatible with
	prior versions.

	Sarahs can be set to negative mode :actual to allow negative
	indexes to be actual keys instead of being relative to the end
	of the array.

	Sparse, integer-indexed elements are now stored separately from
	the non-numerically keyed elements.

	Elements in the sparse array are re-indexed on shift, unshift, and
	delete, just like sequential elements. (Re-indexing never occurs
	in negative mode :actual, however.)

	Many more Array and Hash methods have been implemented.

2013-07-28 Version 0.0.4
	Fixed a bug in the insert! method.

2013-07-13 Version 0.0.3

2013-07-08 Version 0.0.2
