2014-03-31 Version 2.0.0

	Major rewrite. Note: #slice and #slice! are incompatible with
	prior versions.

	Sarahs can be set to negative mode :actual to allow negative
	indexes to be actual keys instead of being relative to the end
	of the array.

	Sparse, integer-indexed elements are now stored separately from
	the non-numerically keyed elements.

	Elements in the sparse array are re-indexed on shift, unshift, and
	delete, just like sequential elements. (Re-indexing never occurs
	in negative mode :actual, however.)

	Many more Array and Hash methods have been implemented.
